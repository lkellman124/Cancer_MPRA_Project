# First, make bowtie indices for barcode and snp region


# PROCESSING MPRA SEQUENCING DATA FROM FASTQ TO READ COUNTS
# Paired end sequencing for plasmid library QC
# Instructions on installing the packages with conda are at the bottom 

# Starting from Ibby-plasmidlib_Full_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq, Ibby-plasmidlib_Full_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq

# 1. Starting with read2, which contains the barcode
# unzip the read2 fastq file and send it to fastx_trimmer
# In this library (which may not be like the future libraries you make) the 18th through 33rd bases are the barcode - not my usual MPRA set up
# The fastx_trimmer command trims read 2 down to the barcode
# '|' sends the output of gunzip (the unzipped fastq file) into the next command (fastx_trimmer)
# -f specifies first base you want to keep
# -l specifies last base you want to keep
# -o specifies output file name - it'll print the specified bases in fastq format to this file
# -Q33 tells fastx how Illumina has encoded the quality scores
# -v is verbose - it'll print a small summary to the terminal 
gunzip -c Ibby-plasmidlib-Full_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz | fastx_trimmer -f 18 -l 33 -Q33 -o bc-trimmed.fastq -v

# 2. The barcode is sequenced on the opposite strand of the library, so we want the reverse complement
# Command is fastx_reverse_complement
# -i specifies input file (I put in the trimmed file from the last step)
# -o specifies output file
fastx_reverse_complement -Q33 -i  bc-trimmed.fastq -o bc_trimmed_rc.fastq -v

# 3. Extract the UMI
# In this library, the UMI is the first 15bp of read 1
# umi_tools is a package for dealing with UMIs
# extract takes out the UMI and adds it to the read identifier
# --bc-pattern is where I specify the length of my UMI (for this, it's 15bp right at the beginning of read 2)
# if the UMI isn't the first bases of the read, specify those other bases with an X and use N for the UMI
# ie, if the read was my index followed by the UMI, I would say "XXXXXXXXNNNNNNNNNNNN" (8 bp index, 12bp UMI)
# --stdin specifies the file to get the UMI from (for me, the I2 file)
# --read2-in is where you add the file with your reads - for this, it's bc_trimmed_rc.fastq
# --stdout specifies the output file
umi_tools extract --bc-pattern=NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN --stdin=Ibby-plasmidlib-Full_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz --read2-in=bc_trimmed_rc.fastq --stdout=bc_umi_extracted.fastq --read2-stdout

# 4. Align the reads to a reference "genome" of my barcodes using bowtie
# I've attached another file with instructions on how to make the bowtie index file
# -p 8 specifies that my computer has 8 processors, so it'll run in parallel (just makes it a bit faster)
# -k 1 says only search for one alignment (bowtie can stop once it's found the barcode that matches, there shouldn't be multiple that match)
# norc says it shouldn't try to align using the reverse complement
# -x is the directory where bowtie2 should look for the index to align to and the name of the index (don't specify extension though, bowtie will find what it wants)
# then I list the input file (the umi extracted reads from the last step)
# -S is the file name to write the alignments to
# -no-unal says the reads that didn't align shouldn't be added to the file
bowtie2 -p 8 -k 1 --norc -x /Users/laurakellman/Documents/MPRA/Ibby/SequencingPipeline/Indices/Barcode/ibbylib_bc_index bc_umi_extracted.fastq -S bc-aligned.sam --no-unal


6724229 reads; of these:
  6724229 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    2198045 (32.69%) aligned 0 times
    4526184 (67.31%) aligned exactly 1 time
    0 (0.00%) aligned >1 times
67.31% overall alignment rate


# 5. Convert the sam file of alignments to a bam file
# just to make it compatible with umi_tools down the line
samtools view -S -b bc-aligned.sam > bc-aligned.bam

# 6. Sort the bam file
# The file needs to be sorted and indexed for umi_tools dedup
samtools sort bc-aligned.bam -o bc-aligned-sorted.bam

# 7. Create an index for the sorted bam file
# umi_tools dedup needs this
samtools index bc-aligned-sorted.bam

# 8. Deduplicate reads
# Takes the reads and deduplicates based on their UMI and mapping coordinate
# -I specifies input file
# -L is the name of the file it'll log its progress on
# --out-sam says output a sam file
# --no-sort-ouput tell it not to bother sorting the output
# -S is the output file 
umi_tools dedup -I bc-aligned-sorted.bam -L logfile_bc.txt --out-sam --no-sort-output -S bc_dedup.sam

# 9. Make it into a tsv for count_tab
# the count_tab function from umi_tools is going to count the number of distinct UMIs corresponding to each feature
# The count_tab function wants a tab separated file, this command is just to get the output of the last step into that format
# first column is readID_UMI, second column is the 'gene' it mapped to (for us, gene is something like barcode ID or snoRNA name)
# awk scans a file line by line, and splits it into fields, and performs an action on them.
# Here, the separator is default white space. Each field is denoted $1, $2,... If a line has 4 words separated by spaces, it'll call them $1, $2, $3, $4
# The first part of the phrase '$1 !~ /^@/ ' specifies which lines to act on
# It says don't act on lines where the first words starts with @ (there's a header type thing at the beginning of the file that 
# we don't want to include)
# {print $1"\t"$3} says what to do to each lines - print the first word ($1), then a tab ("\t"), then the third word ($3)
# $1 is the read identifier and UMI, $3 is the gene it aligned to
awk '$1 !~ /^@/ {print $1"\t"$3}' bc_dedup.sam > bc_dedup_reformat.tsv

# 10. Count up the unique reads for each gene
# umi_tools count_tab is going to count up the unique read/umi combinations for each gene
# outputs a tsv file with the 'gene' in one column and the counts in another
umi_tools count_tab -I bc_dedup_reformat.tsv -S bc_counts.tsv -L bc_count.log

# INSTALLING PACKAGES
# if you don't have it already, I recommend installing conda and then bioconda to help install the other packages
# there are a few ways to install, here are some links: 
# https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html
# https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual (I think graphical installer requires python 3.8 to be installed)

curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# to install bioconda, run these commands in this order (https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html):
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Install fastx_toolkit
conda install -c bioconda fastx_toolkit

# Install bowtie2

# Install umi_tools
conda install -c bioconda umi_tools

# Install sam_tools
